title: Bench Building Initiative

---
The bench building initiative started with the realization that bus-goers should have a more safe and comfortable way to wait for the bus than what is currently provided by Iowa City at most bus stops. 
â€‹
Our goal is to advocate for basic bus stop needs like benches, shelters, and charging stations. These additions to bus stops would provide public transit users with the safety, comfort, and convenience they deserve while they wait for the bus.
