The Socialist Feminist Working Group brings a more prominent feminist perspective to DSA and a socialist perspective to the mainstream feminist movement. We organize around feminist issues such as reproductive justice including economic justice and other issues that especially impact working class and poor women.
We know that the fight for democratic socialism must include diverse perspectives because, in the words of Audre Lorde, “the failure to recognize difference as a crucial strength is a failure to reach beyond the first patriarchal lesson. In our world, divide and conquer must become define and empower.”
