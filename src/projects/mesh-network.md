# Mesh Network

The mesh network project is working to create a citizen-owned and operated network to provide internet access to the Iowa City community.  ICDSA is partnering with [Public Space One](http://www.publicspaceone.com/) to establish our first hubs in the network.

This project takes inspiration from existing community mesh network projects like [Freifunk](https://www.nycmesh.net/) and [NYC Mesh](https://www.nycmesh.net/).

## How does it work?

Hub sites will be connected via radio (TODO: hardware info) to connect hubs which will provide wifi access to citizens near the hub.

## Project Status

Currently we are working to create our first hub connection between the two Public Space One buildings on Gilbert St.
