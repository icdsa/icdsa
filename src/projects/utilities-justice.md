The Utility Justice committee is working towards public utilities. This will create affordable, equitable access and democratic control to basic human needs such as: Gas, Electric, Water, Internet

â€‹We aim to achieve these goals through canvassing, town hall meetings, tabling and direct action.
Everyone should be guaranteed basic human rights such as utilities, and profit should not get in the way of an equitable community.
