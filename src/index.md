We are the Iowa City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, the largest socialist organization in the United States.

As Democratic Socialists, we are committed to empowering ordinary people in the workplace and the economy. We know the only way for us to achieve the broad social, racial, economic, and environmental transformation we seek is with bold principles and a broad democratic movement.

Here in Iowa City, we are currently working on a campaign to achieve housing justice, beginning with our movement to organize an Iowa City Tenants Union. By coming together, we will be able to address our concerns and achieve fair, affordable housing for all.


A better world is possible. Letâ€™s work for it, together. Learn how to [get involved](./get_involved).
